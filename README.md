# Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-s-and-Women-s-Soccer-Matches
This project conducts a rigorous statistical hypothesis test to investigate a sports journalist's observation that more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches compared to men's matches. Using data from official FIFA World Cup matches (excluding qualifiers) since January 1, 2002, the project applies statistical methodology to validate empirical observations rather than relying on anecdotal evidence. The analysis utilizes two separate datasets containing historical match results scraped from reliable sources, with comprehensive data spanning both men's and women's international football matches. Using a 10% significance level, the project tests the null hypothesis that mean goal-scoring is equivalent between men's and women's World Cup matches against the alternative hypothesis that women's matches have higher average goals. This practical application of hypothesis testing demonstrates how statistical rigor transforms observational hunches into evidence-based conclusions, making it valuable for sports journalism, analytics, and data-driven storytelling in the sports industry.
